# ðŸŽ“ TechTrainerTim's Academic Geocities Revival Implementation Plan

*Because sometimes the best way forward is a nostalgic step back to when the web was wild and academics ruled Usenet*

## ðŸ“š Project Vision: Cornell-Era Academic Geocities Authenticity

Transform `techtrainertim-neocities` into an authentic mid-90s academic personal homepage that would make any Cornell CS grad nostalgic, while maintaining professional credibility for modern visitors.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Design Philosophy

- **Academic Authenticity**: Think CS department faculty pages circa 1996
- **Controlled Chaos**: Geocities aesthetic without user experience destruction  
- **Professional Nostalgia**: Retro enough to delight, modern enough to function
- **Interactive Engagement**: Real visitor interaction that builds community

*"Remember when the web was weird, wonderful, and wonderfully academic? Let's bring that energy back, one blink tag at a time."*

**Next Action**: Implement Phase 1.1 "Best Viewed In" notice and hit counter research.

**Questions**: 
- Which NeoCities-compatible services should we investigate for the hit counter?
- Do you have specific Cornell CS faculty pages you remember that could inspire design decisions?
- Should we create a "historical accuracy toggle" for visitors who want full retro vs. modern hybrid experience?
